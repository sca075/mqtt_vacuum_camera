NOTICE
MQTT Vacuum's Camera renders the images of the Vacuums connected via MQTT with Home Assistant (mainly Valetudo ones),
extracting and utilizing data from Vacuums firmware through MQTT to create a detailed map image with vacuum coordinates,
walls, LiDar data, virtual restrictions, paths, cleaned areas, and segments (rooms).
The author of this component developed it independently and is not associated with the Valetudo project or its creators.
The scope of this project is to provide a visual representation of the vacuum's maps within Home Assistant.

Origin of the Work
This work is based on Valetudo firmware, which is an open-source project aimed at providing a cloud-free solution for
robotic vacuums within Home Assistant. The integration for Home Assistant allows users to visualize the maps,
facilitating the control of their MQTT or Valetudo-compatible vacuums within the Home Assistant ecosystem.

Trademarks
This component does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
Valetudo firmware's creators (the Licensor), including "Valetudo" and "Valetudo Vacuums," except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of this NOTICE file.

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
