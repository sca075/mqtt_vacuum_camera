### Material Rendering (Wood, Tiles, Carpets)

***Category:*** Camera Configuration - Material Detection and Rendering

![Material Rendering Menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0751fb5-51c8-40cf-bfea-2c730d9ef92e)

***Description:***
The Material Rendering menu allows you to configure how different floor materials are detected and displayed on your vacuum's map. This feature supports three types of materials:
- **Wood Planks** - Detected wood floor areas
- **Tiles** - Detected tile floor areas  
- **Carpets** - Detected carpet/rug areas

## Material Settings

### Wood Plank Settings
- **Wood Plank Color** - Set the color used to render wood floor areas (RGB color picker)
- **Wood Transparency** - Set the transparency level for wood overlays (0-255, where 0 is fully transparent and 255 is fully opaque)

### Tile Settings
- **Tile Color** - Set the color used to render tile floor areas (RGB color picker)
- **Tile Transparency** - Set the transparency level for tile overlays (0-255)

### Carpet Settings
- **Hide Carpets** - Toggle to show/hide carpet areas on the map
- **Carpet Color** - Set the color used to render carpet areas (RGB color picker)
- **Carpet Transparency** - Set the transparency level for carpet overlays (0-255)

### General Material Settings
- **Disable Material Overlay (Wood & Tiles)** - Toggle to completely disable wood and tile material detection and rendering

## How to Access

1. Open your camera's configuration options
2. Select **"Material Rendering"** from the main menu
3. Configure the desired material settings
4. Submit to save your changes
5. Use **"Back to Main Menu"** to return to the main configuration menu

## Material Detection

Material detection is performed by your vacuum cleaner's sensors and reported through the map data. The integration renders these detected materials as colored overlays on top of the base floor map, allowing you to visually distinguish between different floor types.

## Transparency Tips

- Use transparency values to create layered effects where materials blend with the underlying floor color
- Lower transparency values (closer to 0) make materials more see-through
- Higher transparency values (closer to 255) make materials more opaque
- Experiment with different combinations to achieve the desired visual effect

## Notes

- Material detection availability depends on your vacuum model's capabilities
- Not all vacuum models support material detection
- The number and types of materials detected may vary by vacuum model
- Material overlays are rendered on top of the base floor and room colors
