## How to Access

3. Choose the desired operation
4. After completing an operation, you'll return to the Floor Management menu
5. Use **"Back to Main Menu"** to return to the main configuration menu

## Floor-Specific Trim Settings

Each floor maintains its own trim settings, which control how the map edges are cropped:
- **Left Trim** - Pixels to trim from the left edge
- **Right Trim** - Pixels to trim from the right edge
- **Top Trim** - Pixels to trim from the top edge
- **Bottom Trim** - Pixels to trim from the bottom edge

This allows you to customize the map display for each floor independently, accommodating different floor layouts and sizes.

## Navigation

The Floor Management menu includes a **"Back to Main Menu"** option, allowing you to easily return to the main configuration menu without exiting the options flow. This makes it convenient to perform multiple floor operations in sequence.

## Notes

- Multi-floor support requires a vacuum model that supports multiple floor maps
- Each floor is stored with its own unique identifier
- Trim settings are floor-specific and do not affect other floors
- The active floor determines which map is displayed by the camera
- Deleting a floor is permanent and cannot be undone
- At least one floor must remain configured at all times
