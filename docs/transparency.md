### Colours Transparency ###

***Category:*** Camera Configuration - Transparency Settings

The colour used in the creation of each element of the maps are RGBA.
The Alpha channel of the colour "A" (transparency) is customizable from the camera options.
At the initial setup of the camera, the colours Alpha data load in the configuration are default.

Those values are:
- 255 = Full color no transparency.
- 0 = Transparent = not visible.

As we build several layers on top of one another, applying transparency to one of the colours can result in interesting colour mixtures.

## Accessing Transparency Settings

The transparency settings are now organized in a dedicated submenu with four sections:

1. **Base Colours Transparency** - Configure transparency for general map elements (walls, zones, paths, etc.)
2. **Floor Transparency** - Configure transparency for the floor/single room color
3. **Rooms 1-8 Transparency** - Configure transparency for rooms 1 through 8
4. **Rooms 9-16 Transparency** - Configure transparency for rooms 9 through 16

At the bottom of the colours configuration pages there is a switch that will display the transparency settings relative
to the colours you just edited. By turning on the "Configure Transparency" this page will be shown.

It is possible to use the slide bar or simply input the value.
