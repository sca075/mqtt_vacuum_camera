# Valetudo Vacuum Camera


### Current Release: [![GitHub Latest Release][releases_shield]][latest_release]

![Screenshot 2023-12-27 at 13 37 57](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/assets/82227818/c47bfbfb-b25d-4927-a2e4-4a025932b311)


## Valetudo Vacuums maps in Home Assistant was never so easy.

**About:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Valetudo [Hypfer](https://valetudo.cloud/) or [RE(rand256)](https://github.com/rand256/valetudo) Firmware connected to Home Assistant via MQTT, [easy setup](./docs/install.md) thanks to [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)  and guided Home Assistant GUI configuration.

**What it is:**
Recently designed successor of ICantBelieveItsNotValetudo is [ValetudoPNG](https://github.com/erkexzcx/valetudopng) that can be used as alternative. 
This custom component anyhow is simple to install and setup, decode and render the vacuum maps to Home Assistant in few clicks. 
When you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the:
[lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (recommended)](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card) from HACS as well.

Configuration of the card (thanks to [@PiotrMachowski](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski)) once the camera is installed requires:

*calibration source to be set to camera **not to identity**.*
```
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
```

The below pass automatically the data to use the card please **do not forget to use the internal_variables** .
*Your topic can be obtained also from the camera attributes vacuum_topic.*

```
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_yourvacuum
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera 
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
internal_variables: 
  topic: valetudo/your_topic  
  ```

We did work also a little to help the author of the card, we guess soon a new version of the card will be released.
Those settings will be automatically setup in the card as soon the vacuum and camera will be setup.

### How to install:
Via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz//setup/download) please follow. The instructions in [here](./docs/install.md) show detailed steps and will help to set up the camera also without HACS (manual setup).

### Features: 
<details><summary> We here List what this camera offers as futures.</summary>

1) **Automatically Generate the calibration points for the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card** to ensure full compatibility to this user-friendly card.
2) **Automatically Generate rooms based configuration when vacuum support this functionality**, this will allow you to configure the rooms quickly on the [lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card). Both firmwares are now supported.
3) **The camera take automatically [snapshots](./docs/snapshots.md) (when the vacuum idle/ error / docked)**
4) **Change the image options** directly form the Home Assistant integration UI with a simple click on the integration configuration.
   - **Image Rotation**: 0, 90, 180, 270 (default is 0).
   - [*Cropping function*](./docs/croping_trimming.md) (At boot the camera automatically trims and reduces the imges sizes. The standard Valetudo images size 5210x5210 or more).
   - Base colors are the **colors for robot, charger, walls, background, zones etc**.
   - **Rooms colors**, Room 1 is acrually also the Floor color (for vacuum that do not supports rooms).
   - From v1.5.0 the camera [**Trim automatically the images**](./docs/croping_trimming.md). From the first image you will get the images already without the need to trim them.
   - It is possible to **display on the image the vacuum staus**.
   - We also added the **[transparency level custom setup](./docs/transparency.md) for all elements and rooms** from v1.4.2.  
5) This integration make possible to **render multiple vacuums** as per each camera will be named with the vacuum name (example: vacuum.robot1 = camera.robot1_camera.. vacuum.robotx = camera.robotx_camera)
6) The camera as all cameras in HA **supports the ON/OFF service**, it is possible to *suspend and resume the camera streem as desired*.

## Notes:
- This integration is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allows us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant. Tested also on Docker Supervised "production" enviroment (fully setup home installation).
