# Valetudo Vacuum Camera
## Integration for Valetudo Vacuums to Home Assistant


![img_1](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/assets/82227818/78752c27-1754-4d1f-9109-3003b36a1900)

**About:**
Extract the maps for rooted Vacuum Cleaners with Hypfer Valetudo Firmware to Home Assistant via MQTT, [easy setup](./docs/install.md) thanks to HACS and guided configuration via Home Assistant GUI.

**What it is:**
Recently deisgned successor of ICantBelieveItsNotValetudo is [ValetudoPNG](https://github.com/erkexzcx/valetudopng) that can be used as alternative, althought we wanted to simplify the setup of a camera that decode the vacuum maps and render it to Home Assistant, therefore, when you want also to control your vacuum you will need to also install the:
[lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card (recommended)](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card) from HACS as well.

Configuration of the card (thanks to @PiotrMachowski) once the camera is installed requires:
*calibration source to be set to camera **not to identity**.*
```
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
```

The below pass automatically the data to use the card please do not forget to use the **internal_variables** *your topic can be retrived also from the camera attribe vacuum_topic.* 

```
type: custom:xiaomi-vacuum-map-card
entity: vacuum.valetudo_yourvacuum
vacuum_platform: Hypfer/Valetudo
map_source:
  camera: camera.valetudo_vacuum_camera 
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
internal_variables: 
  topic: valetudo/your_topic  
  ```

**Known Supported Vacuums:**
- Roborock.V1
- Roborock.S50
- Roborock.S5
- Dreame D9
- Dreame Z10 Pro
- Give us feedback please ;) (waiting for your vacuum to be add to the list as in general it works with all flashed Valetudo vacuums)

### Current Release: [![GitHub Latest Release][releases_shield]][latest_release]

### How to install:
Via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz//setup/download) please foolow the instructions in [here](./docs/install.md). This detailed guide is to setup the camera, there are you can can find the instructions to configure the client that will grab the vacuum data from HA.

## Futures:
1) **Automatically Generate the calibration points for the lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card** to ensure full compatibility to this user friendly card.
2) **Automatically Generate rooms based configuration when vaccum support this fucntionality**, this will allow you to configure the rooms quickly on the [lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card).
3) **The camera take automaticly a snapshot (vacuum idle/ error / docked)** and sore it in the www folder of HA. It is thefore possible to create an automation to send the screenshot to your mobile in different conditions as per below example, the vacuum is in idle for 30 second, or the camera took a snapshot 5 sec. ago.. (you need to edit the automation in yamil becase of the boolean value True is translated to "True" from the UI editor. **(please keep in mind that this image will be not automatically deleted from your www folder)**:

```alias: Vacuum stopped at position
description: vacuum camera notification with image
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - camera.your_camera
    attribute: snapshot
    from: false
    to: true
    for:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 5
condition: []
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
    data:
      message: Vacuum Camera Snapshot
      title: Vacuum Camera Snapshot
      data:
        image: /local/snapshot_your_vacuum.png
mode: single
```

*This function will store also a zip file with diagnostic data on the www folder, we filter the data relative to this integration from the HA logs and those data are stored only if the
debug function in HA is active ***(we don't store data in the www folder if the user don't specificly logs the data)***.*

4) **Change the image options** directly form the HA integratios UI with a click on the integration configuration.
 - **Image Rotation**: 0, 90, 180, 270 (default is 0).
 - [*Cropping function*](./docs/croping_trimming.md) (default is 50% of the standard Valetudo size 5210x5210 = 2605x2605).
 - Base colors are the **colors for robot, charger, walls, background, zones etc**.
 - **Rooms colors**, Room 1 is acrually also the Floor color (for vacuum that do not supports rooms).
 - From v1.3.2 is possible to [**Trim the images**](./docs/croping_trimming.md) as desidered.
 - It is possible to **display on the image the vacuum staus**.
 - We also added the **transparency level custom setup for all elements and rooms** from v1.4.2.  
5) Possibilty to **integrate multiple vacuums with this integration** as per each camera will be named with the vacuum name (vacuum.robot1 = camera.robot1.. vacuum.robotx = camera.robotx)
6) The camera as all cameras in HA **support the ON/OFF service**, it is possible to *supend/resume the camera streem as desired*.

## In plan:
- Improving the rooms zones export to the card (at current it requires manual adjustments).


## Notes:
- This integration is developed and tested using a PI4 with Home Assistant OS fully updated [to the last version](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), this allows us to confirm that the component is working properly with Home Assistant. Tested also on Docker Supervised "production" enviroment (fully setup home installation).
   

### Tanks to:
- @PiotrMachowski inspiring this integration and his amazing work.
- @Hypfer for freeing the vacuums from the clouds and contiunsly improvig our vacuums :)
- @billyourself for providing us the data to evolve this project.
- And to all of you using this integration and reporting any issues, improvemnts and vacuums used with it.
